This project is an AI image detector which allows users to upload an image,
and request the AI to classify this image. Keep in mind that this program 
has limitations in what it can detect. 

This program uses streamlit which is a web based app which allows users
an interactive way to upload images, request classification, and view the 
top five predictions. 

The model used is MobileNetV2 which is pre-trained lightweight model from 
TensionFlow's Keras API. A lightweight model has limitations in its training
so it won't correctly classify all images. There is also a list of items 
that the model was trained to detect. You can see the list via this link:

In general, the model can classify images of animals and other general 
objects although it can't identify specific brands or names of living and 
non-living objects. 

In order to run the file, open the terminal and type: 
"uv add streamlit tensorflow opencv-python" . (Don't include double quotes)
This will install packages and dependencies needed for running the program. 
If the previous command doesn't work, you may need to install uv first using 
this command: "uv init ." . 

After install the dependencies, type "uv run streamlit run main.py" to run the 
file You may also need to reset the terminal if you want to run it again later on. 

When run, a browser will open up and you will see a webpage where you 
can upload an image. This program only accepts images in png, jpg or jpeg 
format. After an image is successfully uploaded, click the Classify Image
button and the predictions will be displayed at the bottom of the page. 

The file named 'Classifier_use_case.png' demonstrates an example of how the 
model is used.
